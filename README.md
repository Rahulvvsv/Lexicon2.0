# Lexicon2.0 Hackathon conducted by IARE


Agriculture Web Portal


This project is made by me and my friends @Rajesh and @KhajaBaba when we participated in Lexicon 2.0 Hackathon.(We didnt win it thogh)
We were supposed to build 16 features but we were able to build 12 of them.
It was a good experience building this all night long 
It took a total of 22 hours to build this.
